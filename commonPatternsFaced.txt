General Common Patters
    Divide and Conquer
        Mergesort 
        Divide into multuple sub probs 
    Backtrackracking 
    Two Poiter Approach 
    Recursion
        Steps:
            1. Define the problem w/ variables 
            2. Define mathematically the Recursion
            3. Time and Space complixity (Can we improve)
        Greedy
        DP 
        Complexity 
    Greedy 
        Usually sort 
        Scheduling Problems 
        Knap Sack (Fractional is greey 0/1 is not [if you know you know])
        Locally Optimum Problems 
        Not ALWATS OPT, consider coin change problem
